		     Multi-format DBF-Editor BDBFS.
		     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The BDBFS is the powerful editor of DBF-files. It has
easy-to-use interface, supports the basic formats of DBF-s
databases, memos and indexes (Clipper,FoxPro,dBase,SIX,FlexMemo) and can 
execute a lot of operations with databases.

To install BDBFS you should place BDBFS.EXE & BDBFS.HLP
somewhere in PATH.

Usage:  BDBFS <file.dbf> or
	BDBFS <mask> (f.e. *.dbf)

You can use additional parameters. See BDBFS.HTM and CMDLINE.TXT.

You can use BDBFS.REG to install BDBFS as default WINDOWS DBF-Editor.

It is desirable to place BDB_WCLP.EXE somewhere in PATH under 
Windows 2000/XP.

BDBFS was linked in protected mode, so you can't use 286-s.

BDBFS is shareware. See register.frm for details.
BDBFS can be freely distributed.

Thank you for trying BDBFS.
