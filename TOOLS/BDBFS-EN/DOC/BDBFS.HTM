<h4>1. Why BDBFS?</h4><pre><pre>


In fact, there are a lot of analogues, I know near 20 viewers/browsers.
The popular File Managers have a plug-ins. It is possible also to use
firm DBU from Nantucket/CA, embedded tools of FoxPro, dBase, and so on.

Nevertheless, BDBFS has a niche.
At a development BDBFS the motto was:
	" We'll make with the chosen base, all that we want! "

You can use practically all functions necessary for daily jobs with bases!
Almost all of them can be called by pressing hot-keys.
Besides it is desirable to have "near at hand" an uniform product for
jobs with different formats of bases and indexes.

So, BDBFS is able:

	- automatically or optionally to choose a format
	  of indexes and MEMO-fields from Clipper,FoxPro,dBase4,SIX
	- to edit records in a mode BROWSE or EDIT
	- to print chosen base (optionally into file), entire or on
	  condition
	- to print form from special report file
	- to modify base structure
	- to optimize base structure
	- to print structure on the printer or into a file
	- to search records matching a condition (LOCATE / CONTINUE)
	- to search a context without binding to fields
	- to search in current field
	- to copy records
	- to copy contents of separate fields from the left and right
	  sides, from below and from above
	- to set an existing index (or tag)
	- to make a new index (or tag)
	- to reindex or rebuild all tags
	- to make "soft" index search
	- to make wildcard index search
	- Replace fields matching a condition
	- Sum, Count, Total set of records matching a condition
	- Delete/Recall records matching a condition
	- Copy to File / Append from, including conditions and
	  different text formats. The transformation and renaming of
	  fields is possible. MEMO-fields can be converted to
	  different format
	- to export to HTML, XML, XLS formats
	- to set filters
	- to sort base
	- to set the necessary order and quantity of fields,
	  their headings. The calculated fields are possible! Thus
	  the chosen cut can be printed out and is saved for further use!
	- to calculate any Clipper-expression
	- to assign variables
	- to clear all fields of record at once
	- to make different conversions with text fields
	- to change modes of input
	- to work with the mouse
	- to choose all conditions from a history
	- to save and to restore an environment
	- to read ini-files
	- to highlight with color various cells matching a condition
	- to work with the own clipboard and Win-clipboard
	- "to freeze" fields for viewing
	- to search  maximum / minimum in a field
	- to change the disks / directories (Filer)
	- to use long names Win9x

	- and other pleasant trivialities.

Almost all functions can be called as through hot keys, so
and through the menu.

Most of functions are clear for any xBase-man (though acquaintance with
Clipper it is desirable). Some explanations are below. Appointments of
all hot keys see in HELP and in <a href="#pp1">SUPPLEMENT I</a>.

<h4>2. Supported formats of the data.</h4><pre>


The formats of xBase-files are supported fully at present time:

	 dBASE3/Clipper		 (DBT/NTX)
	 FoxPro			 (FPT/IDX/CDX)
	 dBASE4			 (DBT/MDX)
	 SIX3			 (SMT/NSX)

If the database has memo-field, the appropriate driver is defined
automatically. Besides, you can set the default driver in an ini-file
or through the menu.

FoxPro (SIXCDX) driver is default.

Except for standard Clipper-fields, Float (FoxPro) and
VariField (SIX) are supported.

You'll be asked for password for SIX ciphered files.

The new formats of Visual FoxPro, dBASE5, FlagShip, FlexMemo are
supported in a <a href="#p34">forced mode</a>.

It is really possible to make support of NDX, if it is necessary
for somebody else.

Unfortunately, I have not the drivers for other existing
formats (Comix, Inx, etc) :-(.
<a name="p2cp">
BDBFS can switch DOS/Windows (OEM/ANSI) codepage "on-fly"
by pressing <tt>Ctrl+TAB</tt>.

The variables _OEM_SET, _ANSI_SET define codepage set. They could be defined
in <a href="#p16">initialization files</a> or in <a href="#p16_1">AutoOpen files</a>,
so it is possible to select the codepage for each database.

<h4>3. Editing of records.</h4><pre>


The initial mode of BDBFS is "VIEW".

For starting of edition ("BROWSE" mode) it is necessary to press
<tt>Enter</tt> in chosen field, then you receive practically Browse of FoxPro:
keys <tt>Up, Down, PgUp, PgDn, Tab, Shift+Tab</tt> are acceptable.

Besides BDBFS passes in a mode "BROWSE" by pressing any "simple"
key depending on a type of a field. For example, if current field's type
is Numeric, editing started by pressing any figure, and this figure is
displayed at once. For an exit from a mode "BROWSE" it is necessary
to press <tt>Escape</tt> or <tt>Ctrl+W</tt>. As against FoxPro (dBase),
special keys are not necessary to be pressed for editing a memo-field.

	There are four modes of input in "BROWSE".
	-------------------------------------------------------
	Modes           <tt>Enter</tt> in any            <tt>Enter</tt> in last
	                field                   field of record
	-------------------------------------------------------
	"Usual"         Go to next field        Stop input
	"Lock Enter"    Go to same field        Go to same field
	                in next record          in next record
	"Enter/skip"    Go to next field        Go to first field
	                                        in next record
	"Enter/stop"    Stop input              Stop input

The modes could be switched during input by pressing <tt>F4</tt>.

Except for a mode "BROWSE" there is a mode "EDIT". It allows
editing of the fields "vertically". This mode is acceptable from a
mode "VIEW" through hot key <tt>Alt+E</tt>(dit).

It is sometimes convenient to edit a symbolical field exceeding
the size of the screen, as a memo-field. It could be made by pressing a key
<tt>Alt+W</tt>(ide).

You can undo the editing changes (by <tt>Ctrl+U, Alt+BS</tt>). Undo
buffer is defined by variable _UndoSize and could be from 0 to 4095
actions (default 1024). Any global operation (like ZAP, PACK) clears the
undo buffer.

<h4>4. Expressions of conditions.</h4><pre>

At a choice of many functions BDBFS, you will be requested for condition
of selection or searching. It is possible to vary expressions in such
conditions widely enough. Any system and user functions (<a href="#p32">plug-ins</a>)
can be applied.
Sole restriction - length expressions (no more than 255 symbols).
It is possible three kinds of quoters in character expressions:
 - "", '', [].

	<em>Examples:</em>
		Num > 15

		IsMy .AND. ((cName>'Z') .OR. (cFor $ 'ABC'))

		(YEAR(dIssue)< 2000) .AND. (LEFT(name, 1) =='"')

<center><form>
<input type="button" value="To contents" onClick="window.location.href='#contents'">
</form></center>
<p><HR><a name="p5">
<h4>5. Replace modes.</h4><pre>

BDBFS supports three Replace modes (all - in current field):
	- constant expression		<tt>Alt+F4</tt>
	- varied expression		<tt>Ctrl+F4</tt>
	- in the current record 	<tt>Alt+R</tt>

A difference between <tt>Alt+F4</tt> and <tt>Ctrl+F4</tt> we'll explain
on an example:

Let us assume that current field is numeric and record is 15. Now we set
the expression of replacement Recno()+2 and the scope - all records.

Then the value 17 will be brought in all records by <tt>Alt+F4</tt>,
and accordingly 3,5,7.. by <tt>Ctrl+F4</tt>.

What is necessity for Replace in the current record, if it is
possible simply to correct it? But imagine, that the field contents
3242756 and it is necessary to multiplicate it on 234. With <tt>Alt+R</tt> it
is simple - Field*234.

<tt>Shift</tt> with any replace function (f.e. <tt>Ctrl+Shift+F4</tt>),
causes the confirming for each record. It's especially convenient with
varied expression.

If type of replace expression doesn't match type of current
field BDBFS makes an attempt to convert the replace expression. For
example, if current field has type CHARACTER and you input 123 (not
"123") in replace dialogue, BDBFS convert the expression to string.
If conversion is impossible, BDBFS shows the warning.

<input type="button" value="To contents" onClick="window.location.href='#contents'">
</form></center>
<p><HR><a name="p6">
<h4>6. Append/Copy/Export.</h4><pre>

<tt>F3</tt> simply adds the empty record, <tt>Alt+F3</tt> - offers to copy
contents of current or last record.

It is possible also to press <tt>F3</tt> in a mode "BROWSE", then new
record will be added with the copied current field.

It is possible also to make "Append from file" (<tt>Ctrl+F9</tt>), and
if file's extension is other than .DBF, inquiry of file's type will be
made: SDF, WITH DELIMITERS, DBF. Same concerns and to "Copy File" (<tt>Ctrl+F3</tt>).

It is possible also to append from "myself" (current base).

There are two conflict situations with appending: incompatible field
types and numeric overflow. In BDBFS the disputable concept is now
accepted: the maximal performance of operations. It means, that in the
first case the attempt of types transformation is made, and in second
case the greatest possible number enters in a field. For example, if
field's length is 3 and number is 1200, the number 999 will be entered.

At copying a file it is possible to specify only required fields
(by pressing <tt>Alt+F2</tt>).

The transformation and renaming of fields is accessible also at copying
(to base, but not to SDF). It's some kind of mini-"Query By Example". For
example, you can set expressions in the list of fields:

	Num, Num*2 AS Double, Upper(Char), CTOF(Char) AS Secret

The optional "AS" &lt;column_name> clause specifies the field's
name in the target base (Num*2 AS Double - the field in new base
will be called "DOUBLE").

If the target field is not named (word "AS" is not used) and a
select item is expression, a field will be named Exp_??, where ?? -
serial number in the list (is similar to FoxPro).

If the expression can't be calculated, it is ignored.

See also the description of <a href="#pp4dbtrans">function DBTrans()</a>.

<a name="p6_1">
It is possible also to export the base to formats HTML, XML and
MS EXCEL (XLS). Those operations are accessible through the menu
File - Export to HTML, Export to XML, Export to XLS.

The translation OEM-to-ANSI is requested at any export operation.
If you prefer to omit the question (it is especially useful when
the export called from <a href="#p33">command line</a>), you could set
the variable _l_exp_o2aq:=.F. in <a href="#p16">ini-file</a>. The variable
_l_exp_o2a at the same time defines th necessity of translation, by
default _l_exp_o2a==.T..

Export to XLS is realized in Biff5/Biff7 format without sheets. The field
starts from column "B", the symbol "*" in column "A" means the record
marked for deleting. Maximum length of character fields is 255 symbols.

At export to XML:
	- the database name is used as root tag (if the name begins from
	  digit, the symbol "_" is added first);

	- the word "Record" is used as tag for each record;

	- the fields are described as tags not attributes;

	- internal DTD are used;

	- following attributes are used for each record:
		- record number in database ("RecNo");
		- sequence number in established index or tag ("KeyNo");
		- deleted status ("Deleted" - when the record is marked);

	- following  attributes are used as obligate for fields:
		- "type" - the field's type;
		- "len"  - the field's length;

	- following  attributes are used as additional for fields:
		- "dec" - when the field has fractional part;
		- "realtype" - when the type of data differ from
		  field's type (f.e., Strongly-type VariFields or
		  <a href="p34">"forced" fields</a>);
		- "valtype" - for fields with variable type (Weakly-Typed
		   VariFields or Variant);

	- all character fields are described as CDATA section;

	- the fields with DATE type are written down in DTOS() format;

	- the logical fields are written down as "1"/"0";

	- the following are written down in comment section:
		- the name of source database;
		- the description from descript.ion (if present);
		- the index expression (when the index or tag is active).

<h4>7. SUM.</h4><pre>

The summation is always performed on the current field (including
<a href="#p9">calculated fields</a>). It is possible to summarize numerical or
character fields (i.e. SUM(VAL(field))). It is meant, that you know,
that you do. It is also possible to use the <a href="#pp4Sum">function Sum().</a>

<h4>8. Search modes.</h4>

BDBFS has wide possibilities of a searching - standard LOCATE and SEEK, and
special, oriented for non-professional user.

<a name='p8_1'>
<h4>8.1. Search an index (tag).</h4><pre>

To start SEEK press <tt>F9</tt>. The warning will be shown, if no any active
index or tag.

When you search index key of DATE-type, it is not necessary
to write CTOD. So, is equally correct

	12/03/93  CTOD('12/03/93')  DATE()

By search on an index of a symbolical type the value should be
concluded in inverted commas. However, if the expression of search begins
with figure or symbol with a code more than 127, the inverted commas are
not obligatory.

By default the search is conducted in a mode SoftSeek OFF (SET NEAR - for
habitual to FoxPro). To set a mode SoftSeek ON it is necessary to make

		<tt>Alt+G</tt> Set(9, .T.)	//see Set.CH,

or to write Set(9, .T.) in an ini-file.

Sometimes it's necessary to find not unique records in an index. It could
be made by pressing <tt>Alt+2</tt>. The cursor thus will be established on
duplicating record.

The search on a mask (naturally, in an index of a character type)
is accessible also. The mask is similar to DOS.

	<em>Example:</em>
		<tt>Alt+[</tt> 'B?LL',	//found: BILL
		<tt>Alt+Shift+]</tt>	//found: BYLL

		<tt>Alt+ [</tt> 'JO*SON' //found: Johnson,Johanson etc.

<a name='p8_2'>
<h4>8.2. LOCATE.</h4><pre>

In addition to usual LOCATE/CONTINUE operator (keys <tt>F7,  Alt+F7</tt>), it is
possible to execute backwards (from bottom to top) searching, by pressing
<tt>Ctrl+Shift+F7</tt> (start) and <tt>Alt+Shift+F7</tt> (continue).
Keep in mind that continue of searching  forward and backwards
<tt>Alt+Shift+F7, Alt+F7</tt> is possible to alternate.

The searching in current field is, possible, the simplest method. To do
this press <tt>F11</tt> and input the required. It will be searched the
occurrence if the field has character type and exact coincidence for other
field types. The menu for field searching could be called by pressing <tt>Ctrl+Shift+F11</tt>.
Indeed, the expressions entered in this mode are converted to LOCATE
expressions, so the keys <tt>Alt+Shift+F7, Alt+F7</tt> (CONTINUE) are working.

<a name='p8_3'>
<h4>8.3. Contextual searching.</h4><pre>

The contextual search is the text-editor-like search. It means that
names and types of the fields are ignored. For example, you know, that
somewhere in database are the information about some client. Simply press
<tt>Alt+I</tt>, input the name (or part of name) and (in case of success
searching) the focus will be installed on founded record and field.
Press <tt>Alt+Shift+I</tt> to continue for next occurrence.

The contextual search is about 5 times faster than LOCATE.

Keep in mind that:
	- the dates, indeed, are saved in YYYYMMDD format, so, if 12/12/2006
was inputted, nothing will be founded, it needs to input 20061212 - without
separations.
	- the search is not executed for usual MEMO-fields.
For VariField MEMO-fields the searching will be executed for constant part.
For example, if the field has V20 specification, the search will be
executed in first 14 symbols.
	- the search is executed without fields borders consideration.
It means, that the information  at the "border" between fields could be
founded. For example, the field F1 contains "123", and the field F2 contains
"456", then the string "34" will be founded. Besides, consider that the
records, marked as deleted, contains the asterisk (symbol '*') in the same
first position, so it will be founded too.

There are two settings influencing on contextual search.

The setting "Expand the context search expression" (the variable _lGSExp,
default is .F.) controls the calculation of expression before the search.
So, if expression 2*2 was inputted, it will be searched the string "2*2"
when _lGSExp = .F., and the symbol "4" when _lGSExp = .T. .  Keep in mind
that even when _lGSExp = .F., you can turn on it one-time by pressing <tt>Ctrl+W</tt>
instead of <tt>Enter</tt> after expression's input.

The setting "Additional condition of context search" (the variable  _lGFCond,
default is .T.) allows specify an additional condition in LOCATE-like style.
For example, you searches for Smith, but you need only Smith in certain age.
Then you can input  Age > 60 in the additional condition.
As far as context search is much faster than LOCATE, such bundle allows to save
time and does not loss the  flexibility.

<a name='p8_4'>
<h4>8.4. Other.</h4><pre>

It is possible to search for maximal and minimal value in fields of any type.
To do with press <tt>Alt+M</tt>. See also <a href=#pp4findmax>FindMax() function</a>.

It is possible to search for a longest string (without end spaces) in text fields.
To do with press <tt>Ctrl+L</tt>

To go to some records by number press <tt>F6</tt>. Besides, by pressing
<tt>Ctrl+Shift+F6</tt> it is possible to find the record by shift from current and
by key number in index (tag).

You can use <a href=#pp4like>Like() function </a> for extended
expressions of search.

<p><HR><a name="p9">
<h4>9. Set Fields.</h4><pre>

On <tt>Ctrl+F2</tt> you can set the contents, names (headings), show format and
order of fields. The contents of a field can be any allowable expression.
The symbols of national alphabets in the contents now are allowable only
in russian version (see NATIONAL.TXT).

	<em>Example:</em>
	Contents of a field: If(Deleted(), [Yes], [No])
	Name: Is marked?

	To divide the name of the field use the symbol ;.
	<em>Example:</em>
	This;Field;Name		//3 lines

You could also set the picture and width for each field.
The formats of the pictures are described in any xBase language.

	<em>Example:</em>
		Field: Money
		Picture: 999,999.99

To finish changes press <tt>F10</tt>. Then you can press again <tt>Ctrl+F2</tt>
to restore all fields.

The calculated fields will not be editable. Besides, they can
be used in expressions.

The fields was marked as deleted (on <tt>DEL</tt>) will not be shown and
edited. <tt>F8/F7</tt> blocks/unblocks all fields below current.

The required order can be established by pressing <tt>Ctrl+Up</tt> or
<tt>Ctrl+Down</tt>.

The required order and contents of fields can be established
consistently. Let's assume, we have removed from viewing some field.
And now we don't want to see another field, not only previous. Press
again <tt>Ctrl+F2</tt> (to restore all fields), again <tt>Ctrl+F2</tt>, then <tt>F5</tt> and
you can see previous established fields. Correct further, etc..

Even without entry into Set Fields mode it is possible to change the fields
by pressing <tt>Ctrl+Shift+Left, Ctrl+Shift+Right</tt> and hide (minimize) and
recover the fields by pressing <tt>Ctrl+H, Ctrl+Shift+H</tt>.

Set Fields does not influent on "Copy TO" operation.

<h4>10. Calculation of expressions.</h4><pre>

By pressing <tt>Shift+F6 (Alt+G(o), ?)</tt> it is possible to calculate almost any
correct Clipper expression of length up to 255 symbols. Not to mention
it is necessary to remember, what day was Date()-21 or quickly to compute
Log(Exp(1)) :-), it has turned out rather interesting simulator for
Clipper-programmer. It is possible, for example, to experiment with
parameters of Memoedit, to understand, at last, what differs Bin2i from
Bin2w or to be curious, what is Descend("¾¼¾º­").

It is possible to use almost all functions from Clipper.Lib and
Extend.Lib, number useful (on my sight) functions of known libraries
Six3, NanFor, Clipper Tools, Netto, Blinker, emulation of some functions
FoxPro, and also number of special functions BDBFS.

The list of functions <a href="#pp4">see in SUPPLEMENT IV</a>.

<h4>11. Variables initialization.</h4><pre>

On <tt>Ctrl+F5</tt> you can initialize variable (or to set it's new value).

For simple variable it is necessary simply to execute assignment

	new=5
	word:='daddy'
	today=date()

For the announcement of a array it should be described:

	arr[20] or arr=Array(20)

Then it is possible to make Arr[3]=Exp(12.09).
However, direct assignment is also allowable:

	Arr := {10,20,'example'}

Any correct Clipper expression are allowable in the right part.

What for all this is necessary?

You can, f.e. store result of previous operation and use it later:

	<tt>F6</tt>				//sum current field
	<tt>Ctrl+F5</tt>	Sum1:=__sum	//store it

It is sometimes convenient to calculate expression, and then to use it in
conditions. Using assignment variable and calculation expressions it is
possible even to write small programs. Try, f.e., to make following:

	<tt>Ctrl+F5</tt>	aPrg=Array[Adir('*.prg ')]
	<tt>Alt+G</tt>		Adir('*.prg ', aPrg)
	<tt>Alt+G</tt>		ForAch (5,10,24, 'Program', aPrg)

Selecting the index with non-standard extension.

	<tt>Ctrl+F5</tt>	_oldind:='MyOwn.FIL '
	<tt>Ctrl+F5</tt>	_req=0

Choosing the database from backup copies.

	<tt>Ctrl+F5</tt>	_mask = '*.bak'
	<tt>F4</tt>

Printing the database with a small font and with the slogan.

	<tt>Ctrl+F5</tt>	_PSCode ='We are the champions ' +chr(15)
	<tt>F2</tt>

It is possible to assign the block of a code

	<tt>Ctrl+F5</tt>	bck = {| i|i+1} , then
	<tt>Alt+G</tt>		Eval(num)

<h4>12. Structure modifying.</h4><pre>

After change of structure, previous version is saved with extension BAK.
If there was a memo-file, it is saved with extension TBK.

If at updating there is a situation of numerical overflow, it will be
brought 0 in a field.

The known Clipper-trick is realized in the program  - symbolical
fields with length more than 255 symbols. It is made so: a field
Field_Dec keeps Mod(Length, 256), a field Field_Len - remainder.
For example: length of a field is 700. Then Field_Dec=2, Field_Len=188.
But to enter necessary length in BDBFS it is enough to correct Field_len.
Then the necessary sizes will be brought automatically.

<tt>F9</tt> (except for the driver SIXMDX) causes function of structure
optimization (like in OTTO utility from SIX-driver). It is made with
using VariField by the following rules:

	- All CHARACTER fields greater than 16 characters are
	  defaulted to 10 byte "V" fields. However, for short CHARACTER
	  fields with data of a fixed length, you may want to change them
	  back to "C" types manually instead of using "V" types.

	- All MEMO fields are defaulted to 6 byte "V" fields.

	- All NUMERIC fields greater than four bytes long and less than
	  11 bytes long are converted to four byte "I" (long integer
	  fields.

	- All 8 byte DATE fields are converted to 3 byte DATE fields.

For non-English named fields see NATIONAL.TXT.

<h4>13. Records inserting.</h4><pre>

As is known, Clipper doesn't have the operation INSERT.  But sometimes it
would be desirable very much. Therefore it is necessary to follow by
heavy way: append, to move all downwards, to clear top. It can take long
time on the large bases. INSERT does not work with active INDEX or TAG.

<h4>14. TOTAL and SORT.</h4><pre>

The differences between TOTAL in BDBFS and in Clipper:

	- "ON" expression always uses IndexKey(0) or it's part, so TOTAL
	   doesn't work in SORTed base;
	- ALL fields are copied to the new database (Clipper excludes
	   the memo-fields);
	- if field "TOTALCOUNT" exists, it will be filled with number of
	  totalled records on each key expression;
	- fields with alias (like base->fld1) aren't supported.

The differences between SORT in BDBFS and in Clipper:

	- sorting on memo-fields is possible (on first 255 symbols);
	- deleted records retain their deleted status in sorted database.

<h4>15. Saving / restoring an environment.</h4><pre>

You can define any variable, set conditions of search and summation,
specify an index and necessary fields etc., and then save all in a usual
memo-file, by pressing <tt>Shift+F1</tt>.

If then at any moment to press <tt>Shift+F5</tt> and to set a name of

environment from <a href="#p33">command line</a>:

	BDBFS &lt;name of MEM-file>.

Certainly, could be as much as necessary files of an environment in the
directory. The file BDBFS.MEM is used by default.

If variable _AutoSave: =.T. is defined in INI-file (or directly from
the program), the file BDBFS.MEM is created in the current directory
automatically at an exit.

If variable _AutoRestore: =.T. is defined in INI-file and BDBFS.EXE
is started without parameters, a file BDBFS.MEM from current directory is
restored automatically.

<h4>16. Initialization files.</h4><pre>

You can read the file of initialization from <a href="#p33">command line</a>
(bdbfs &lt;file.ini>) or later, by pressing <tt>Ctrl+F12</tt>. Any ini-file
represents from itself an usual text file, containing assignment
variables, and also, probably, execution of some functions,
mini-programs. In fact, most statements of Clipper and other xBase
dialects are allowable in ini-files. Variables are defined in ini-files
will be then accessible in the program. The statements defined specially
for BDBFS must begin with symbol #. This symbol could absent in
statements with standard Clipper syntax.

The following operations are defined:

<a name="p16_a">
<h5>A. Assignment.</h5><pre>

	<em>Syntax:</em>
		&lt;var>:=&lt;expression>		or
		&lt;var> = &lt;expression>		or
		#define &lt;var> [&lt;expression>]	or
		#undef &lt;var>

	<em>Examples:</em>
		MyVar=100
		MyVar := 100
		MyVar=Sqrt(4)
		#define MyVar 100
		#undef MyVar

In the case of #define, as against of Clipper and C #include-files,
the variable will be announced and are accessible for all session time.
Default &lt;expression> for #define is .T.. The statement #undef release the
variable.

Can be useful the defining of code blocks in ini-file. Then they
can be used in program as functions.

	<em>Example:</em>
	//in ini-file
		Squart = {|i|	'the Area of a circle with radius '+STR(i,3)+;
				' = '+LTRIM(STR(3.1415 * i * i,16,2))}

	//in program
		{?} Squart(4) or
		{?} Eval(Squart,4)


<a name="p16_b">
<h5>B. Function evaluation without assignment variable.</h5><pre>

	<em>Syntax:</em>
		=&lt;expression>	or
		&lt;expression>

	<em>Examples:</em>
		=Tone(440,3)
		Eval(bEval, 100)

	Keep in mind, that you must use =&lt;expression> form, when
symbol "=" is inside &lt;expression>, f.e.
		=Devout('S='+S)


<a name="p16_c">
<h5>C. Including of another initialization file.</h5><pre>

	<em>Syntax:</em>
		#include &lt;FileSpec>

The attention for Clipper & C programmers: the name of a file
could be written without inverted commas.

&lt;FileSpec> may contain an explicit path and file name as well as a
file extension. If, however, no path is specified, bdbfs searches the
following places:

	- Current directory

	- Directories supplied in global variable _PlugDir
	  (default - &lt;place of bdbfs.EXE>\PLUGINS)

	- Directories specified in the INCLUDE environment variable.

	<em>Examples:</em>
		#include second.ini
		#include 'second.ini'
		#include c:\my\second.ini

As the operation #define is supported, it is possible to include standard
Clipper .ch files, like inkey.ch, Set.ch.  Notice, that #define with
parameters is not supported yet.


<a name="p16_d">
<h5>D. User-defined command.</h5><pre>

	<em>Syntax:</em>
		#xcommand &lt;matchPattern> => &lt;resultPattern>

 &lt;matchPattern> is the pattern to match in the input text.

 &lt;resultPattern> is the text produced if a piece of input text matches
	 	the &lt;matchPattern>.

Patterns can include parameters (match markers). Match markers
are label and optional symbols delimited by angle brackets (&lt;>) that
provide a substitute (idMarker) to be used in the &lt;resultPattern> and
identify the clause for which it is a substitute.

As against commands of Clipper-preprocessor, only one parameter
(or absence of parameters) is supported.

	<em>Examples:</em>

	  #xCommand INVERT =>;
		    DBEval({||Rlock(),IF(DELE(),dbRecall(),dbDelete())})

	  #xCommand MODIFY COMMAND &lt;x> = > ModiFile(&lt;x>)

	  #xCommand EOM(&lt;x>) => FT_LDAY(&lt;x>)

It is most natural to apply commands from calculation of
expressions, for example:

		{?} INVERT

<a name="p16_e">
<h5>E. Defining of command's local table.</h5><pre>

	<em>Syntax:</em>
		#LOCALTABLE

The commands defining by #xcommand operators take some memory and
slow down a little the calculation's execution (the substitution is
tested for each expression). So it is sometimes useful to free command's
table after execution.

	<em>Example:</em>
		#LOCALTABLE
		#include MyCmd.ch

Suppose, the set of commands are defined in MyCmd. The preliminary
definition by #LOCALTABLE guarantees the clearing of resources after
ending of ini-file interpretation.


<a name="p16_f">
<h5>F. MACRO keys definition.</h5><pre>

	<em>Syntax:</em>
		#MACRO &lt;key code> => &lt;a sequence of pressing>
		or
		#MACRO_IN_[scope] &lt;key code> => &lt;a sequence of pressing>

The sequence of pressing can be defined as symbolical line (KEYBOARD
format), or as a array of codes (INKEY format). In the second case it is
possible to set the functional and extended keys, but length of a
sequence is less or equal 16 symbols. The sequence could be a codeblock,
it is useful to vary actions.

Next scopes modifications could be defined:

	#MACRO_IN_BROWSE - main mode,
	#MACRO_IN_DIALOG - dialogues of conditions and field list
	#MACRO_IN_FIELD  - GET mode
	#MACRO_IN_MEMO	 - edition of memo-fields and text files

If the scope is not defined, the macro-key will be active in all modes.

	<em>Examples:</em>
		#MACRO 307 => {-9, 'F', 'A'}
		;Create HTML through menu on <tt>Alt+<</tt>.

		#MACRO_IN_FIELD 308 => "It we'll press quite often at
		edition"N

		#MACRO_IN_DIALOG 383 => 'Like("*",&_C_F)'+REPL(CHR(19),9)
		;<tt>Alt+*</tt> suitable for pattern

		#MACRO_IN_DIALOG 276 => {|| Time()}
		;Codeblock example: <tt>Alt+T</tt> inputs the current time.


<a name="p16_g">
<h5>G. Announcement of the variables.</h5><pre>

	<em>Syntax:</em>
		LOCAL &lt;v1>[:=&lt;xv1>],&lt;v2>[:=&lt;xv2>]	or
		PRIVATE &lt;v1>[:=&lt;xv1>],&lt;v2>[:=&lt;xv2>]	or
		PUBLIC &lt;v1>[:=&lt;xv1>],&lt;v2>[:=&lt;xv2>]

If the variable is not announced as LOCAL or PRIVATE, it exists for the
duration of the program. Local and private variables are visible only
within the current ini-file. The statements LOCAL and PRIVATE are
synonyms.

	<em>Examples:</em>
		#LOCAL cFile,nSum

		LOCAL cFile:="MyFile"

		PUBLIC nSum


<a name="p16_h">
<h5>H. Execution's termination.</h5><pre>

	<em>Syntax:</em>
		#BREAK	or
		#BREAK &lt;condition>

#BREAK without parameter forces the immediate termination of the ini-file
interpretation, #BREAK with &lt;condition> terminate the interpretation
if condition are valid:

	<em>Example:</em>
		#BREAK File("NeedFile")


<a name="p16_i">
<h5>I. Parameters and return value.</h5><pre>

Up to 5 parameters can be passed to ini-file. They are accessible with
_1.._5 identifier. You could also announce own names of parameters in
operator PARAMETERS.

	<em>Syntax:</em>
		PARAMETERS &lt;list of variables>

	<em>Example:</em>
		PARAMETERS nVal,cVal,xVal


Ini-file can return the value to the calling process.

	<em>Syntax:</em>
		RETURN &lt;expression>

	<em>Examples:</em>
		#RETURN 4.
		#RETURN _1*_2+_3

#RETURN doesn't terminate the interpretation, it only defines the
result. There could be more than one #RETURN in ini-file.

The calling of ini-file with parameters is suitable from
calculation or user menu:

	{?} RestoreIni("MyPlug",Date(),"Example",2.4)

You can use the recurrent RestoreIni(), so in "MyPlug" can be written:

	RestoreIni("R2")
and so on.

You can use the direct calling of ini-file as a function:

	{?} MyPlug(par1,par2)

Ini-file should have .ini extension in this case, that is
unessential in case of RestoreIni().


<a name="p16_j">
<h5>J. Alternative execution.</h5><pre>

	<em>Syntax:</em>
		IF &lt;lCondition1>
			&lt;statements>...
		[ELSEIF &lt;lCondition2>]
			&lt;statements>...
		[ELSE]
			&lt;statements>...
		ENDIF

It is the analogue of usual xBase IF..ENDIF statement.

&lt;lCondition> is a logical control expression. If it evaluates to
true (.T.), all following statements are executed until an ELSE,ELSEIF or
ENDIF is encountered.

ELSEIF &lt;lCondition> identifies statements to execute if the
associated condition evaluates to true (.T.) and all preceding IF or
ELSEIF conditions evaluate to false (.F.). Any number of ELSEIF
statements can be specified within the same IF...ENDIF control structure.

ELSE identifies statements to execute if all IF/ELSEIF conditions
evaluates to false (.F.).

IF...ENDIF structures may be nested within other IF...ENDIF
structures up to 10 levels for one ini-file.

	<em>Example:</em>
		IF Continue("Do you want to make something?")
			&lt;statements for "Something">
		ELSE
			Nfind("May be next time...")
		ENDIF

The special cases of #IF operator are operators #IFDEF, #IFNDEF.
They are often used in Clipper #include files for prevention of repeated
loading.
	<em>Examples:</em>

	//in set.ch
	#IFNDEF _SET_CH
		... constants announcements

		#DEFINE _SET_CH
	#ENDIF

	//in plugins\clipper.ch
	#IFDEF _CLIPPER_CH
		#BREAK		//yet another? No, Exit!
	#ENDIF
	...
	#DEFINE _CLIPPER_CH

The symbol # is obligatory in #IFDEF, #IFNDEF.


<a name="p16_k">
<h5>K. CASE - Alternative execution.</h5><pre>

	<em>Syntax:</em>
		DO CASE
			CASE &lt;lCondition1>
				&lt;statements>...
			[CASE &lt;lCondition2>]
				&lt;statements>...
			...
			[OTHERWISE]
				&lt;statements>...
		ENDCASE

It is the analogue of usual xBase DO CASE..ENDCASE statement.

CASE &lt;lCondition> defines a block of statements to execute if
&lt;lCondition> evaluates to true (.T.).

OTHERWISE defines a block of statements to execute if none of the
specified CASE conditions evaluates to true (.T.).

CASE...ENDCASE structures may be nested within other CASE...ENDCASE
structures up to 10 levels for one ini-file.

DO CASE...ENDCASE is identical to IF...ELSEIF...ENDIF with neither syntax
having a specific advantage over the other.

	<em>Example:</em>
	DO CASE
		CASE	_1 &lt; 0
			s := s - _1
		CASE	_1 = 0
			s := 0
		OTHER
			s := s * _1
	ENDCASE

	<em>Syntax:</em>
		[DO ]WHILE &lt;lCondition>
			&lt;statements>...
			[EXIT]
			&lt;statements>...
			[LOOP]
		ENDWHILE	or	 ENDDO


It is the analogue of usual xBase WHILE..ENDWHILE statement.

&lt;lCondition> is a logical control expression. If it evaluates to
true (.T.), all following statements are executed until an #ENDWHILE is
encountered.

#WHILE...#ENDWHILE structures may be nested within other
#WHILE...#ENDWHILE structures up to 10 levels for one ini-file.

	<em>Examples:</em>
		sum:=0
		WHILE !EOF()
			sum:=sum+FieldGet(1)+FieldGet(2)
			DBSKIP()
		ENDWHILE

		WHILE .T.
			....
			IF inkey(0)=27	//ESC

			&lt;statements>...
			[EXIT]
			&lt;statements>...
			[LOOP]
		NEXT	or	ENDFOR

&lt;idCounter> is the name of the loop control or counter variable.
If the specified &lt;idCounter> is not visible or does not exist, a private
variable is created.

&lt;nStart> is the initial value assigned to &lt;idCounter>. If &lt;nIncrement>
is negative, &lt;nStart> must be less than &lt;nEnd>.

TO &lt;nEnd> defines the final value of &lt;idCounter>. If &lt;nIncrement>
is negative, &lt;nStart> must be greater than &lt;nEnd>; otherwise, &lt;nStart>
must be less than &lt;nEnd>.

STEP &lt;nIncrement> defines the amount &lt;idCounter> is changed for
each iteration of the loop. &lt;nIncrement> can be either positive or
negative. If the STEP clause is not specified, &lt;idCounter> is
incremented by one for each iteration of the loop.

	<em>Example:</em>
		FOR i:=1 TO 100 STEP 2
			s:=s+i
		NEXT

<h5>O. Disarmed statements.</h5><pre>

They are: <em>MEMVAR, FIELD, EXTERNAL</em>. These statements are
of no practical importance and was included for compatibility with
existing programs on xBase dialects.

<HR>
A lot of various examples are contained in the demonstration
file Examples.ini and in PLUGINS directory. <a href="#p32">See also ch.32.</a>

At start of the program the attempt is made to read a file BDBFS.INI from
the program's start directory. If file of initialization is not defined
in a command line, then the attempt is made to read a file BDBFS.INI from
the current directory (at its absence is searched BDBF.INI - for
compatibility with the previous versions of BDBF).

Calling of any ini-file (f.e., on {<tt>Ctrl+F12</tt>}) results to
compulsory reopening of current base. If you do not wish it, you should
define variable lNoReOpen:=.T. in any place of ini-file.

<a name="p16_1">
<h4>16.1. Auto Open files.</h4><pre>

 The file with extension .AOP (Auto Open) will be read automatically when
the base with appropriate name will be opened. You can define some
commands, variables, <a href="#p30">menu</a> specific for this database.
Besides, you can define list of necessary fields here. Fields list is
defined in variable FIELDS and headers list - in variable HEADS.  Formats
(show patterns) of fields can be defined in variable PICTURES.  Width of
each fields can be defined in variable Widths. Calculated fields can be
also defined.

	<em>Example:</em>

	Fields:={'Char','Num','Num*2'}
	Heads:={'Character;field','Numeric;field','Double value'}
	Pictures:={, '999,999.99'}
	Widths:={7,,,}

Sometimes there is a necessity to exclude some fields from
browsing. You can do it with statement #EXCLUDE.

	<em>Example:</em>
		#EXCLUDE Secret, KeyField


You can also define other useful instruction (see also <a href="#pp4">SUPPLEMENT IV</a>).
For example it's possible to set index or tag:

	_IndexFile:="MyIndex"		or
	__TagNom:=3			or
	__TagName:='MyTag'

You can interactively define an index and necessary fields (on
<tt>Ctrl+F2</tt>), and then save all this in AOP-file, by pressing
<tt>Ctrl+Shift+F1</tt>.

You can also define the actions executing when current base
is closing. The statements should reside after defining of [close]
section of AOP-file in this case.

	<em>Example:</em>

	//Remember the file creation time
	aD:=Directory('WrkBase.DBF')
	tOld:=aD[1,4]

	[close]
	//Reserve copy if file was changed
	DBCommit()

<h4>20. Compatibility with FoxPro.</h4><pre>

BDBFS is able to look and to edit files FoxPro with memo-fields.
The index files are completely supported.

As it was already noticed, in Browse the keys <tt>Tab, Shift+Tab,
Ctrl+T</tt> are supported.

System variables of printing and the amount of the processed records
have the same names, as in FoxPRO.

In expressions it is possible to use almost all functions FoxPro,
not corresponded with screen (Screen, Menu) and printed forms.

The correctness of locking in a network is provided.

If there is a file EUROPEAN.MEM in the current directory, it is
loaded at start.

(at conformity of types) - <tt>Alt+GreyEnter</tt> or <tt>Ctrl+GreyMinus</tt>.

It is possible to make operations

In a mode of editing of memo-fields the pasting from clipBoard
is accessible. During a showing of result of calculation, summation, etc
is accessible record calculated in ClipBoard. However, it is possible
to save result in a field directly.

The operations of copying to the buffer are also accessible at a showing
of results operations.

It is very convenient to use ClipBoard for the inputting various
conditions. For example, you have set long expression of search. Remember
it by <tt>Ctrl+Grey+</tt>. Now you want to copy all records, satisfying to this
condition. Proceed in dialogue of copying and at inquiry conditions press
<tt>Ctrl+Grey-</tt>.

The ClipBoard contains all expressions placed into them during
current seance and the choice from these expressions is offered when
pasting. You could cancel this "behavior" by assignment the variable
_ClipChoice:=.F., in initialization file or through menu. Last expression

<h4>27. Edition of memo-fields and external files.</h4><pre>

It is possible to use the internal or external editor for edition
of memo-fields, and also external files (by pressing F4 in filer or
through the menu "File" - "Modify text"). The internal editor uses
standard function MemoEdit and works when variable _MemoEditor is not
defined (for example, in an ini-file). Variable could be defined as
String, for example, _MemoEditor:='c:\medit\me.exe' (then always will be
used MultiEdit) or as an array of arrays:

	{Field's Mask,			//f.e "BM*"
	 External editor,		//f.e. "ME"
	 Shift in a memo-field,		//by default 0 - whole field
	 The additional options,	//by default are absent
	 Temporary file			//by default $$BDBF$$.COM }.

The external editor can be not defined, then it is supposed, that
the program(for example, screen-saver) resides in a memo-field, and this
program simply is started. The shift in a memo-field is necessary to set,
if the memo-field keeps the diverse information. For example, animals.dbf
in Delphi's distributive contains a field BMP, where a picture is stored
from 9 positions.

Example:
	_MemoEditor:={	{'BMP', 'pv', 9, '/d'},;
			{'SAVER', '', 0, ",'tmp.com"},;
			{'*','ME ', 0, "};
		     }

So, PV.EXE will be called on a field with the name BMP, the field SAVER
contains executable programs, and for edition all rest will be called
MultiEdit.

The internal editor can't edit files with the size more than 64K. But
also at use of the external editor it is necessary to remember, that the
memo-fields of a format DBT are not capable to store the section more
64K. If your file has large length, at recording it in a field of a
format DBT it will be cut off.

<h4>28. Printing forms.</h4><pre>

Besides a usual printing on F2, it is possible to use the special
report forms. The forms are stored in usual textual files and contain
instructions for definitions of columns, groupings, summarizing, etc.

Report forms could use the variables:

	_aExpr - array of expressions for each column.
	_aHead - array of column's headings. Default == _aExpr
	_aElen - array of column's widths. Default = width of a field

If _aElen is default, width of a column is defined as maximal
between _aElen, width of column heading and _aPict for this column. If
width of a field is more than width of a column, it is made correct
division (up to 10 lines in a column) on separators:

		space tabulation . , ; ? !

	_aPict	 - array of pictures for each column.

	_aTitle	 - report title. Default - nothing. Can be defined as a
		   string or array of strings.

	_cFile	 - output file. Default - name of base + '.PRN'.

	_aSum	 - array of necessity of summation for each column.

	_fCondit - print condition.

	_aFooter - name of additional procedure printing a form footer or
		   array containing the footer.

	_pEveryStep - name of additional procedure or block called
			before a printing of each line satisfying to a
			condition _fCondit

	_aGroup - array specifying report group.
		Structure of an array:
		{
		&lt;expression of grouping>,;
		[&lt;an array or block for a printing of group heading>],;
		[&lt;an array or block for a printing of group footer>]
		[&lt;logical: print the group sum only if more than 1 element
		 are in group>]
		}.
		Default for group heading:
			'Code' + &lt;expression of a grouping>.
		Default for group footer: "Total:".
		Default for a printing of the sum: .F. (to print the sum
		always).

	_nDouble - attribute of necessity of a printing in two columns on
		   a sheet. If 0 or is not defined - one string is
		   printed.  If numerical parameter is defined - is
		   perceived as amount of blanks between two columns.

	_NoAsk - don't confirm the print condition and output file's
		 name.

	_NoShow - don't offer a file for viewing and printing.

	_aPage - array specifying grouping on page.
		Structure:
		{
		 [&lt;an array or block for a printing of page heading>],;
		 [&lt;an array or block for a printing of page footer>]
		}.
	If it's defined, the totals of page are printed. Header
	of page is printed, since second.

	cDivideT, cDivide - delimiter of columns in the header and
		information lines accordingly (default - ':').

	_nCounter - if > 0, a serial line number is printed at the left
		    side of sheet (with width _nCounter).

	CountName - name of a column for serial number (default "NN").
		    It is meaningful only if _nCounter > 0 is defined.

	_PrintZero - whether to print of zero values, by default - .F.

Following variables can be additionally adjusted directly from the
programs (by pressing <tt>F9</tt> in dialogue of a beginning of a printing).

	Numbers of pages on each page		_NeedPrPage
	Standard title				_NeedMainHead
	Title on each page			_lTitleAll
	Header on each page			_NeedHeadPage
	Head's numbers: on first page		_lDgtHdr
			on other pages		_lHdAll
	Eject after each page			_NeedEject
	Starting sequence of the printer	_PSCode
	Final sequence of the printer		_PECode
	The left margin				_LMargin
	Page length (0=tape)			_Plength
	The printer device			_printer
	Whether to append to a file		_NeedApFile

Report-form files have standard extension .BPF and can be loaded through
the menu "Base" - "Read report template".

<h4>32.Plug-ins.</h4><pre>

"Plug-ins" of bdbfs are usual <a href="#p16">ini-files</a>, realizing
some completed function. Some examples (probably useful) are in
PLUGINS\ directory. Send me your plug-ins, best will be published.

Bdbfs searches for Plug-ins (and #include)-files:
	- in current directory;
	- in directories supplied in global variable _PlugDir
	  (default - &lt;place of bdbfs.exe>\plugins). You can
	  define(f.e. in bdbfs.ini) more than one directory:
		_PlugDir:='c:\bdbfs\plugins; d:\MyOwn\plugins'
	- in directories specified in the INCLUDE environment
	  variable.

You can use the plug-ins as usual function, if they have default
extension .INI. Suppose, you have MyPlug.ini. It is then possible, f.e.:

	<tt>?</tt> MyPlug()			//Calculate current

	<tt>CTRL+F5</tt> xVar:=MyPlug()*2	//Assignment

	<tt>F7</tt> MyPlug() > 100		//Searching

Plug-ins could have up to 5 parameters.

	<em>Example:</em>
		MyPlug(2,3,'Hello')

If you need call the plug-in from another plug-in, or plug-in has
non-standard extension, you should use the function RestoreIni().

	<em>Example:</em>
		 BDBFS *.Str

Files with extension STR will be offered.

Parameter /i = &lt;indexname> sets loading a file together with
specified index.

At start with a parameter - name of a <a href="#p15">file of an environment</a>
the attempt is made to restore this environment. Similarly, with a <a href="#p16">file of
initialization</a>.

	<em>Example:</em>
	 	BDBFS Envr.mem


The parameters <b>/NTX /CDX /MDX /NSX</b> set the default RDD (usually
it's defined in bdbfs.ini). You can use also <b>SIX[driver]</b> form.

	<em>Examples:</em>
		BDBFS MyBase /SIXNSX

		BDBFS MyBase /ntx /i=char


The parameter <b>CREATE</b> allows to begin the work with a creating of
a new database.

	<em>Example:</em>
		BDBFS MyNew /CREATE


Parameter <b>FORCED</b> causes <a href="#p34">a forced mode</a>.

Parameter <b>WIN (ANSI)</b> causes the opening of a database with
Windows codepage. Default codepage is  DOS (OEM).

	<em>Example:</em>
		BDBFS MyDbf /ANSI

See also <a href="#p2cp">codepage switching "on-fly"</a>.

Besides, there are some parameters forcing BDBFS to work in
batch mode - REINDEX, REBUILD, HTML, XML, XLS, PACK, CHECK and varieties
of STRUCT_ parameter. In batch mode BDBFS executes the defined operation
and finishes the work.


Parameter <b>REINDEX</b> causes reindexing of a base. A compound index
(CDX, NSX, MDX) is reindexed automatically, for reindexing of simple index
it should be specified in third parameter with a key /i. If any
index is not found, the appropriate message will be shown.

	<em>Examples:</em>
		BDBFS f_w_cdx REINDEX
		BDBFS f_w_ntx /REINDEX /i=MyNtx.ntx


Parameter <b>REBUILD</b> causes a full rebuilding of a compound index
file (CDX,NSX,MDX). It's some longer than reindexing, but protects from
some strange bugs and decreases the file size in most cases.

	<em>Example:</em>
		BDBFS f_w_cdx /REBUILD


Parameters <b>HTM (HTML), XML, XLS</b> causes export to a corresponding
file format.

	<em>Examples:</em>
		BDBFS MyDbf HTM			//MyDbf.htm is generated
		BDBFS MyDbf /HTML=e:\1		//e:\1.htm is generated
		BDBFS MyDbf /XLS		//MyDbf.xls is generated

If target file exists, you will be asked for rewriting. So, if you wish
to rewrite existing file without confirming, delete it before!

<a href="#p6">Ch. 6</a> contains additional information about exporting.


Parameter <b>PACK</b> causes packing of a base. Inasmuch as it is
dangerous operation, warning will always shown (except the case when
the variable _lPckNoAsk:=.T. was defined in ini-file).


Parameter <b>PRINT</b> causes initialization of <a href="#p28">BPF-file</a>.

	<em>Examples:</em>
		BDBFS Customer /PRINT		//Customer.BPF used
		BDBFS Customer /PRINT=Annual	//Annual.BPF used


Parameter CHECK causes <a href="#p31">checking of a base size</a>.


Parameter <b>STRUCT</b>_ allows to execute all file operations with database
structure, usually allowable from DISPLAY STRUCTURE mode (<tt>Alt+F2</tt>).

Variety of parameter:
	STRUCT_PRINT	- print the structure description to
			  print device
	STRUCT_FILE	- print the structure description to
			  file (database.STP)
	STRUCT_EXTENDED	- create the file in COPY STRU EXTENDED
			  format (database.STE)
	STRUCT_COPY	- create the empty file of same structure
			  (database.STR)
	STRUCT_PROGRAM	- create the program generating this
			  structure and tags of compound index,
			  if it exists (database.STG).

All postfix of STRUCT_ parameter can be reduced up to 4 symbols.

	<em>Example:</em>
		BDBFS MyDbf /STRUCT_PROG

Parameter <b>RUN</b> calls defined <a href="#p32">plug-in</a>. In contrast to
start BDBFS with parameter - file of initialization (in fact, it is
plug-in too), processing of plug-in, defined in /RUN, start after database
opening. Additional parameters of plug-in should be defined with commas and
without space and also character parameters should enclose in quotation marks.

	<em>Examples:</em>
		BDBFS MyDbf /RUN=Test()

		BDBFS MyDbf /RUN=Test(1,'"example"')



It is possible to apply the command FOR to work with the catalogue.

	<em>Examples:</em>

Reindex all
		FOR %a in (*.DBF) DO bdbfs %a REINDEX

Create HTMLs in subdirectory _HTMLS_
		echo y | DEL _HTMLS_\*.HTM
		FOR %%a in (*.DBF) DO bdbfs %%a HTM=_HTMLS_\%%a
		REN _HTMLS_\*.DBF _HTMLS_\*.HTM

The happy owners of 4DOS can save the command (and time):
		DEL /y _HTMLS_\*.HTM
		FOR %a in (*.DBF) DO bdbfs %a HTM=_HTMLS_\%@NAME[%a]

Make the database documentation
		FOR %%a in (*.DBF) DO BDBFS %%a /STRUCT_FILE
		ECHO Databases of system > All_Dbf.txt
		FOR %%a in (*.STP) DO COPY All_DBF.TXT+%%a All_Dbf.TXT

<h4>34. Forced mode.</h4><pre>

BDBFS supports different formats of DBF with the aid of so called
RDD (Replaceable Database Driver) of CLIPPER. On the other hand, many
formats recently have appeared, are not supporting by RDD (at least, I
have no these RDD).

They are: new fields and headers of Visual FoxPro, dBASE5, FlagShip,
FlexMemo. Besides, there are some programs, calling the fields "wrongly",
f.e. beginning with figure.

Therefore, I wrote the special "forced" mode in BDBFS, allowing to
process such bases without RDD. For this purpose the heading of base is
corrected "in flight" to supported RDD and is restored after all works.

So, in "forced" mode BDBFS supports the following formats:

	- Visual FoxPro (field types Currency, DateTime, Binary, Integer,
	  AutoIncrement, Double, Picture, General, new memo-format, new
	  header format);
	- dBASE4, dBASE5 (field type Bitmap, new headers);
	- FlagShip (field types 2,4,8, new headers);
	- FoxBase 1.0 (old header);
	- FlexMemo (new memo-format);
	- Clip (field type Variant);
	- and, potentially, all another possible (and unknown to me)
	  field types, which will be processed as Character in this case.

Non-standard field names are transformed by the following rules:

	- if there are Code Page FoxPro 1200-1299 in header,
	  AnsiToOem() executed;
	- non-alphabetical and non-digital symbols are replaced
	  by symbol "_".
	- if the name begins with figure, it is anticipated with "_".

"Forced" mode can be applied also for processing of bases with
"long" (>64K) memo-fields, as use of standard drivers in this case causes
the internal error of Clipper.

For today the following restrictions work:

	- the base is used only in an exclusive mode;
	- PACK-operation is prohibited if the base contains memo-fields;
	- MODIFY STRUCTURE-operation is prohibited;
	- in a memo-field it is possible to write down up to 64K
	  and standard way SX_Blob2File/SX_File2Blob does not work.

"Forced" mode can be activated from <a href="#p33">command line</a> with parameter
/FORCED (f.e. BDBFS MyBase /forced) or by setting of variable _lForced:=.T.
in <a href="#p16">ini-file</a>. Besides, the question about activation are asked at opening,
if "forced" mode is not active yet and non-standard structure are
detected.

For access to some "non-standard" types of fields (f.e., at use
in expressions, searches) it is necessary to use special functions (usual
edition, viewing, replacement of additional efforts not require):

	- Memo, Picture, Bitmap - types
		MemoSrc(&lt;field_name>) - returns the string
	- Currency - type
		YToCurs(&lt;field_name>) - returns the number
	- DateTime - type
		TToC(&lt;field_name>) - returns the string
	- Binary - type
		CToF(&lt;field_name>) - returns the number
	- 2 - type
		Bin2I(&lt;field_name>) - returns the number

	<em>Example:</em>
//Set filter to field Cur1 of type "Currency"

		<tt>Alt+Shift+F</tt> YToCurs(Cur1)>100

Once again I remind, for processing of base in the forced mode,
it is necessary to correct its heading! Therefore, if, f.e., the power
will be lost or current window will be closed during the works, the
structure of base will be corrupted (in case of Visual FoxPro even rather
essentially).

	  - number of a key in an index and quantity of records in
	    the filter (without calculation) are not accessible. It is
	    reflected in correctness of indicators showing;

	- long names in filer are shown up to 16-symbols.

	- a nonrestorable mistake "Disk overflow" during COPY or APPEND
	  operation.

	- due to mistake in realization of TBROWSE object,
	  not all fields in base can be shown. By default,
	  quantity of fields, are shown in BDBFS is limited to 170
	  (experimental limit on my computer is 173). You can
	  experiment by setting _nBrowMaxField variable in a INI-file.

	- internal error 1112. It appears on databases with
	  long memo-fields (more than 64K). It's Clipper 5.2 fault (in
	  5.0 it wasn't). You can exclude such fields from viewing
	  in <a href="#p16_1">AutoOpen files</a> (and access them
	  with Sx_Blob2File() function) or use <a href="#p34">forced mode</a>.

	- FoxPro's indexes with expression like alias.field instead
	  alias->field cause the error when index field is changed.

	- noncompact IDX-s are not supported (restriction of SIX3
	  driver).

	- SEEK doesn't work in FoxPro indexes made with established
	  SET COLLATE.

	- BDBFS doesn't start under Win2000/XP. It is not error, you
	  must install DPMI support before. Uncomment (or write) the
	  string like %SystemRoot%/System32/dosx in autoexec.nt.

<h5>B.Called functions.</h5><pre>

It is possible to call any internal function BDBFS, as well as
system in any modes. It looks more natural to use this in a mode of
calculation (<tt>Shift+F6, Alt+G, ?</tt>),or in a mode of assignment (<tt>Ctrl+F5</tt>).

<em>Examples:</em>
	<tt>Alt+G</tt>		Aver('Example')
	<tt>Ctrl+F5</tt>	avrg=Aver('Example')

For presentation of the explanatory we shall conduct on educational base

	NAME	S02	S03	S04
	Your	12	1	13
	Your1	32	2	33
	My	10	3	10
	My1	30	4	0

<a name="pp4b1">
<h6>1. Functions of calculation.</h6><pre>

<a name="pp4Sum">
	SUM( &lt;cExpr> [, &lt;cCond>] ) --> nResult

Sum base on expression cExpr for a condition cCond.
Returns Number.

<em>Examples:</em>
	<tt>Alt+G</tt>	(1)	Sum ('S02+S03', '[My] $ Name')
			(2)	Sum ('S02', '.t.')

	(1) will return 47	(2) - 84

If &lt;cCond> is omitted, the scope is all records.

Except for returned value the result is remembered in variable
	__Sum

<HR>
	AVER(&lt;cExpr> [, &lt;cCond>]) --> nResult

Calculates average on expression cExpr for a condition cCond.
Returns Number.

If second parameter is omitted, it is meant .t.

<em>Example:</em>
	<tt>Ctrl+F5</tt> MediumS2=Aver('S02', '[My] $ Name')

	will return 21

<HR>
	COUN(&lt;cCond>) --> nResult

Counts up quantity of records satisfying to a condition cCond.

<em>Example:</em>
	<tt>Ctrl+F5</tt>  CntMy=Coun ('[My] $ Name')

	will return 2

If second parameter is omitted, it is meant .t.

Except for returned value the result is remembered in variable
	__count

<HR>
	SumLine([&lt;FromField>], [&lt;ToField>]) --> nResult

Summarizes fields "lengthways" records, from &lt;FromField> up to
&lt;ToField>. Default FromField is first field, ToField - last field.
The non-numerical fields are ignored.

<em>Examples:</em> (for the first record)
	SumLine()	--> 26
	SumLine(1,2)	--> 12
	SumLine(3)	--> 14

Except for returned value the result is remembered in variable
	__Go

<HR><a name="pp4like">
	Like(&lt;cEtalon>, &lt;cTest>)

Defines whether or not a character expression is contained in
another expression. LIKE() returns true (.T.) if &lt;cEtalon> matches
&lt;cTest>. &lt;cEtalon> can contain the wildcard characters * and ?. The
question mark matches any single character in &lt;cTest> and the asterisk
matches any number of characters. You can mix any number of wildcard
characters in any combination in &lt;cEtalon>. The function has shown the
same high-speed results, as same function of Clipper Tools (probably,
algorithm is same). But EXE is 0.5K less :-) .

<em>Examples:</em>
	<tt>F7</tt> Like ('spr*.dbf', FileName)

	<tt>Alt+G</tt> Like ('?m*h', 'smith') --> .t.

<HR>
	Crc32(&lt;cExpr>)

Calculates the check sum of a line. The algorithm of PKZIP is used.

<em>Example:</em> the check sum of all fields:
	Crc32(Name+XTOC(s02) +XTOC(s03) +XTOC(s04))

<HR>
	Rand([&lt;nExpr>])

Returns a random number in a range from 0 up to 1.
Everyone ExprN give birth to the identical sequence.

<em>Example:</em> Rand(Seconds())

<HR>
	Random(&lt;nMin>, &lt;nMax>)

Returns random integer in range from nMin up to nMax.

<em>Example:</em> Random(0,1000)

<HR>
	RoundIt(&lt;nVar>,&lt;nPlace>)

Correct rounding off. Clipper not always correctly carries out
operation of a rounding off.

<em>Example:</em>
	Round(1.025,2)		--> 1.02
	RoundIt(1.025,2)	--> 1.03


<a name="pp4b2">
<h6>2. Functions of transformation</h6><pre>

	Capitalz(&lt;cExpr>)	--> ExprC

Returns the specified character expression with initial letter
capitalized and the remaining characters lowercase.

Returns the empty line if parameter is absent.

<em>Example:</em>
	Capitalz('LUGANSK')	-->  Lugansk

<HR>
	Padj(&lt;ExprC>,&lt;cAlign>,&lt;cFill>,&lt;nLen>) --> ExprC

Align the specified character expression with a fill character
to create a new character string of a length &lt;nLen>
(default: current field's length).

&lt;cAlign> defines the method of aligning:
	"L" - String is aligned to left side.
	"C" - String is centered.
	"R" - String is aligned to right side.
	"J" - String is justified.
	"E" - String is expanded.

Default &lt;cFill> is space.

<em>Example:</em>
	//Current field length is 12.
	PADJ("Report",'C')		--> "   Report   "
	PADJ("Report",'E')		--> "R e p o r t "
	PADJ("My Report",'J','.',14)	--> "My      Report"

<HR>
	OemToAnsi(&lt;cExpr>)

Converts each character in a character expression to the
corresponding character in the ANSI character set (default: 1251).

You can change the char set to your own, by defining the variables
_Oem_Set, _Ansi_Set in BDBFS.INI.

<em>Example:</em>
	OemToAnsi('')	--> ËÓÃÀÍÑÊ

<HR>
	AnsiToOem(&lt;cExpr>)

Inverse function to OemToAnsi().

<HR>
	SplitLine(&lt;cExpr>)

Transform the specified character expression to an array.
Array's elements are separated by points.

<em>Example:</em>
	SplitLine('One,Two,Three') --> {'One', 'Two', 'Three'}

<HR><a name="pp4dbTrans">
	dbTrans(cNewBase, Fields [, bFor, bWhile, nNext, lRest])

Copies the current base with an opportunity of renaming or
transformation of fields.

The list of fields is set in inverted commas (as a line), or as
the array (that is necessary at the giving of expressions with points).

If the calculated fields are not defined in the list of fields, the
function works completely as system command COPY.

See also <a href="#p6">topic 6.Append/Copy</a>.

<em>Examples:</em>
	DBTrans('NewFile','Char,Num AS Digit,Num*2 AS Double')

	DBTrans('NewFile',{'LEFT(Char,2) AS Symbol','Num'}, {||Num # 0})

<HR><a name="pp4Tb2Html">

Exports the database to a format HTML. If the name of a file is
not defined - it is requested.

Title of a file (cTitle) is database name by default.

An array of colors aDesign has structure:

	{page background color,
	table background,
	text color for table and header,
	text color for deleted records}.

Default: "navy","blue","white","red".

<em>Example:</em>

	Tb2Html('MyBase','WWW FOREVER!',;
		{'fffffc0','fffff80','00000ff','black'})


<HR><a name="pp4Tb2Xml">
	TB2Xml([&lt;cXmlFile>] [, &lt;cTitle] [, &lt;lYesNo>] [, &lt;cRecName>])

Exports the database to a format XML. If the name of a file is
not defined - it is requested.

If parameter lYesNo==.T. than the words "Yes" / "No" are used for logical
values, otherwise - "1"/"0" constants.

The parameter cRecName defines tag's name for records (by default it is
word "Record").

<em>Example:</em>
	Tb2Xml('MyBase',,"Employes",.T.)

<HR><a name="pp4Tb2Xls">
	TB2Xls([&lt;cXlsFile>] [, &lt;cTitle] [, &lt;lYesNo>] )

Exports the database to a format XLS. If the name of a file is
not defined - it is requested. If title of sheet (cTitle) is defined it
is placed into first row of XLS-file.

If parameter lYesNo==.T. than the words "Yes" / "No" are used for logical
values, otherwise - .T./.F. constants.

<em>Example:</em>
	Tb2Xls('MyBase',"Sellers")

<a name="pp4b3">
<h6>3. Other system functions.</h6><pre>

<HR>
	ModiFile(&lt;cFileName>)	--> .T. at successful record

recno1, recno2 through the internal buffer.

<em>Example:</em>
	Swap(1,3)

<HR>
	WORK(HEAD) --> cResult

Defines the true name of a field on heading.  It is useful in case of the
setting of fields by <tt>Ctrl+F2</tt>, when you don't remember the real
field's name, and its name should be specified, for example, in the
search expression.

<em>Example:</em>
	Work('My name for 2 field') --> 'S02'

<HR><a name="pp4findmax">
	FindMax(NeedMax [, FieldName], [EvalBlock]) - > MaxVal

		  .F. - minimum
	FieldName - field or expression, by default -
			current field.
	EvalBlock - block of a code calculated for
			comparison, by default - value
			FieldName ({|i| i})

<em>Examples:</em>

	FindMax(.T.,'S02 ') - > 32

	FindMax(.F.,'S02 ') - > 10

//Length of the longest name

	FindMax(.T.,'Name ',{|i |Len(Trim (i))}) -> 5
	(is found ' Your1 ')

<HR>
	PrintEdit([cFileName])

Prints the current record on the device of a printing
(default-printer) in an unwrapped kind.

By pressing <tt>Ctrl+P</tt> in BDBFS - into the file with a name
&lt;CurrentBase>.Rec.

Appending/rewriting of a file depends on the appropriate printer's
setting.


<em>Example:</em>

"FOR" cycle. Could be useful, for example, in <a href="#p16">INI-files</a>.
Codeblock bEval is executed when Eval(bFor)==.T..
The cycle variable is transferred to the bEval and bFor as parameter.
bEval and bFor can be of Codeblock or Character type.

<em>Examples:</em>
	cSet:=''
	For(1,254,{|_1|cSet:=cSet+CHR(_1)}) --> '...þ'
