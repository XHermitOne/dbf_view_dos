		NATIONAL LANGUAGES SUPPORTING.

There are two versions of BDBFS now: English and Russian.

Some restrictions are in English version:

	- non-english field names are not supported;

	- alphabetical sorting and indexing is only in ascii-order
	  (but you can use translation tables, see dox);

	- some bank-specific functions not needing (IMHO)
	  for international users are excluded.

I WANT to make versions for other languages. But I need for
your help. Active helpers will take registration.
