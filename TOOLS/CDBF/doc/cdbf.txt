| 1. About             |
+----------------------+

CDBF is a powerful database viewer and editor that lets
individuals and business users access databases directly
without programming.

This small and handy utility offers everything you need
for working with database files and even more: one of the
reviewers for Ziff-Davis Software Library noted that the
program seems to be overloaded with features - so many of
them are available in this seemingly simple tool.

Unlike other similar tools, CDBF doesn't separate the viewing
and editing modes: while viewing a table you can at any time
click on the field to be modified and make all necessary changes.

The program supports all types of DBF files (dBase III,
dBase IV, FoxPro, Visual FoxPro) and their memo fields.

You can export the database tables to text files, DBF files,
Clipper and FoxPro source files (.prg) and SQL Server scripts
(.sql).

Other CDBF features include:
+ Sorting and filtering records
+ Ability to edit memo-fields
+ Ability to print database tables
+ Powerful search and replace
+ Automatic OEM/ANSI character set detection
+ Cutting, copying, pasting and erasing data in selected cells
+ Exporting, deleting, recalling and summing selected records
and more...

There are several different versions of CDBF:
        - CDBF for Windows, GUI version
        - CDBF for Windows, Console version
        - CDBF for DOS, Console version
        - CDBF for Linux, Console version
